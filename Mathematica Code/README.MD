This directory contains the Mathematica notebooks for the spherical Burger's equation, the heat equation and the Laplace equation. Each equation has its own notebook, but the procedure for all three is the same. Each notebook contains comments which explain the process step by step. Some additional comments and explanation about this procedure are explained below. <br>

The first thing that we want to determine is what the adjoint symmetries look like. The $C(i)$ matrices can be found using the Python code, and when using the $\texttt{MatrixExp[m1*a]}$ command it will print out the adjoint matrix of $C(1)$.
